SELECTING JOINTS
joints will highlight in white when selected in the Joint tree widget 
the global world coordinates of every joint update in the Joint widget spin boxes.

TRANSLATING AND ROTATING JOINTS
spin boxes can be used to change joint transformations in world coordinates. parent transformations will cause their children to transform. 

CALCIUM (because calcium gives you bones!)
imports the the joint structure from the json file. 

CONESTOGA
binds the current joint skeleton to the current mesh. vertices will be bound to the two joints which are closest to them out of the entire joint structure. s
you can tell the joints are bound when their names are highlighted in the qtreewidget. 
 after being bound, moving joints will cause the mesh structure to change as well.
